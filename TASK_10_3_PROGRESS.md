## Technical Decisions

### Backend Architecture
- **Route**: `/api/reports`
- **Export Libraries**: exceljs (Excel), jspdf (PDF)
- **Data Source**: Reuse dashboard API logic from dashboard.ts
- **Packages to install**: exceljs, jspdf

### Frontend Architecture
- **Page**: `/reports`
- **Components**: Report builder, preview, export buttons
- **State Management**: TanStack Query + local state
- **Navigation**: Add between Bills vÃ  Settings vá»›i BarChart3 icon

### Report Types Planned
1. **Revenue Reports**: Monthly/yearly revenue, paid vs pending
2. **Occupancy Reports**: Room occupancy rates, available vs occupied
3. **Tenant Reports**: Active tenants, contract status
4. **Bill Reports**: Paid/unpaid bills, overdue analysis
5. **Contract Reports**: Active/expired contracts, expiring soon

### Database Queries Identified
- Bills: aggregate by month/year, status filtering
- Rooms: count by status, occupancy calculations
- Contracts: count by status, date filtering
- Tenants: count active via contract_tenants
- Revenue: sum totalAmount from bills with date/status filters
